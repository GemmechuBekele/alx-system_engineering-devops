Three-Server Secured and Monitored Infrastructure

1. Components:
   - 1 Load Balancer (HTTPS termination)
   - 2 Web Servers (Nginx + App Layer + Monitoring Agent)
   - 1 MySQL DB (with Monitoring Agent)
   - 3 Firewalls (Internet edge, Web tier, DB tier)
   - 3 Monitoring Clients (Sumo Logic/Datadog)

2. Security:
   - HTTPS via SSL on Load Balancer
   - Internal firewalls for segmentation
   - Server hardening and secure SSH

3. Monitoring:
   - Server health, logs, and traffic metrics collected by agents
   - QPS monitored via MySQL status metrics

4. Limitations:
   - SSL termination exposes internal traffic unless encrypted
   - DB is a single point of failure
   - Monolithic servers reduce scalability and maintainability
