A user wants to access the website http://www.foobar.com from their browser.

1. DNS Resolution:
   - The domain name www.foobar.com is resolved using a DNS A record.
   - It maps to the IP address of the load balancer (HAProxy).

2. Load Balancer (HAProxy):
   - Receives incoming traffic from users.
   - Distributes requests to backend servers using the **Round-Robin** algorithm:
     - Each request is sent to a different server in rotation (e.g., Server 1, then Server 2, then Server 1 again).
   - Ensures load is evenly shared between available servers.
   - This setup is **Active-Active**: both backend servers handle requests at the same time.

   - In contrast, an **Active-Passive** setup would keep one server idle until the active one fails.

3. Server 1 (Web Server):
   - Runs **Nginx**, which handles HTTP requests and serves static content.
   - Hosts the **application files** (your website code).
   - Connects to the **Primary MySQL** database for write operations.
   - IP: 8.8.8.8

4. Server 2 (Application Server):
   - Runs the application backend logic (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js).
   - Also contains a copy of the application files.
   - Connects to the **Replica (Read-Only)** MySQL database for SELECT/read operations.
   - IP: 8.8.4.4

5. MySQL Primary-Replica Cluster:
   - **Primary (Master)**:
     - Accepts all write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
     - Replicates changes to the replica node.
   - **Replica (Slave)**:
     - Read-only.
     - Handles SELECT/read queries to reduce load on the primary.

## üîç Why Each Component Is Added

- **2 Servers**: Separate roles (web + app) improve fault isolation, flexibility, and performance.
- **HAProxy Load Balancer**: Prevents overloading one server, improves uptime and traffic distribution.
- **MySQL Replica**: Reduces load on the master, increases read performance, and provides backup capability.

## ‚ùå Infrastructure Issues

1. **SPOF (Single Point of Failure)**:
   - If the load balancer fails, users cannot access the backend, even if servers are online.

2. **Security Issues**:
   - No firewall to filter malicious traffic.
   - No HTTPS for secure encrypted communication.

3. **No Monitoring**:
   - No system to check server health, detect failures, or analyze traffic.
